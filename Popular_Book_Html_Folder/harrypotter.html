        <h1>by J.K.Rowling</h1>
        <p class="bb">Harry Potter's life is miserable. His parents are dead and<br>
        he's stuck with his heartless relatives, who force him to <br>
        live in a tiny closet under the stairs. But his fortune<br>
        changes when he receives a letter that tells him the truth<br>
        about himself: he's a wizard. A mysterious visitor rescues<br>
        him from his relatives and takes him to his new home,<br>
        Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. After a <br>
        lifetime of bottling up his magical powers, Harry finally <br>
        feels like a normal kid.
